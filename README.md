If you are going to use Intelij,
You Should First follow these steps :

## IntelliJ:
As of SHAFT_Engine '4.0.20200220-beta' you can now use IntelliJ in addition to Eclipse to manage your test project.

After checking out the project to your IntelliJ you may face an exception that prevents tests execution.

In that case you need to add the SHAFT_Engine custom listeners to your TestNG execution template, as IntelliJ doesn't natively inherit this list from the pom.xml file.


## listeners:
# 1- com.shaft.tools.listeners.AlterSuiteListener
# 2- com.shaft.tools.listeners.SuiteListener
# 3- com.shaft.tools.listeners.InvokedMethodListener
